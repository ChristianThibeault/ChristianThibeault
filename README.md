# 👋 Hey, I'm Christian

I'm a physicist currently finishing a PhD in solar astrophysics, where I build simulations of the Sun’s magnetic field (and try not to crash the cluster).

Lately, I’ve been shifting my focus to backend and systems engineering. I build clean systems, clever tooling, and CLI-first apps (mostly in Go) to make working with computers a little bit more fun.

### 🔭 What I’m working on

- [`gosysmesh`](https://github.com/ChristianThibeault/gosysmesh)  
  A CLI-first system monitor that collects CPU/mem info over SSH. Written in Go, with a focus on clarity and good terminal aesthetics (color, tree-style output, live refresh).

- [`footprint`](https://github.com/ChristianThibeault/footprint)  
  A command-line tool that wraps `strace` to provide human-readable insights into a program's execution. It summarizes file access, memory usage, and network activity, with output formats like summaries, verbose reports, JSON, and beautiful tree visualizations.
  
- [`Cadena`](https://github.com/Cadena-Platform/Cadena)  
  A web app that helps students in Quebec buy and sell used books. I worked mainly on the backend (Django + PostgreSQL + Azure).
