# 👋 Hey, I'm Christian

I'm a physicist-turned-backend developer who enjoys building clean systems, clever tooling, and simulations that don’t explode.

I spent the last few years writing solar dynamo simulation code during my PhD in astrophysics. These days, I’m focused on backend engineering and systems-monitoring tools in Go.

### 🔭 What I’m working on

- [`gosysmesh`](https://github.com/ChristianThibeault/gosysmesh):  
  A CLI-first system monitor that collects CPU/mem info over SSH. Written in Go, built for fast debugging and good aesthetics (think color, tree output, live refresh).

- [`footprint`](https://github.com/ChristianThibeault/footprint):  
  A CLI-first system monitor that collects CPU/mem info over SSH. Written in Go, built for fast debugging and good aesthetics (think color, tree output, live refresh).


- [**Cadena**](https://github.com/Cadena-Platform/Cadena):  
  A web app that helps students in Quebec buy and sell used books. I worked mainly on the backend (Django + PostgreSQL + Azure).
